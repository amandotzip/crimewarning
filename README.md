## TODOðŸ“ƒ
- Use Attom to get crime data given phone coordinates,and check nearby coordinates
- Given Attom response, make courier send any form of notificatoin (could also send the users coordinates to the trusted sendee)
- Add icons to nav bar, continue recoloring, change name of headers and buttons
- Add page dicussing the implications of what an unsafe area is and how they can be supported (ex. locals or businesses)
- add welcome page with logo and name, like in the design image
- design devpost submission document
- make video to add to devpost submission for presentation of app
- Make icon and final name for project



## If we have time
- Make launchpad website that provides download link or demo of app, could honestly just link to devpost but it should look fancy. Bootstrap would be very fast for that website.
- Make functioning firebase login system
- data viz of crime information

- ~~fucntioning of courier api to send messages through several means (for example sms or push or email)~~
- ~~basic UI setup~~



## Domain.com ideas if we have time to submit (we should, we all get to submit one)

- make domain that makes you say "bah" and sheep will pop up every time
- bahbahbah.tech
- BAHINDYOU.tech
