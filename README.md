## Inspiration
One of our members was investigating the crime ratings in Baltimore as they were moving there for a job. While researching neighborhood safety, he found that stereotypes about Baltimore being a dangerous area were not usually true and often misleading.

## What it does
Vanguard is a user safety app that provides the local crime rating of the user's current location, and then notifies the user and trusted related users of their crime rating and location. This is compared to the national average, where the average is 100.

## How we built it
Using react native so that the product can be shipped to iOS and Android, we utilized Courier API for notifying users, the Google Maps API, and the Attom API for crime data.

## Challenges we ran into
Getting setup with different tools like Expo took a while, and new tools like Courier had a slight learning curve as well. School/other time commitments did take away time from working this weekend, but we all still learned and enjoyed working on the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the various APIs to work together was cool. A couple of us were new to working with different third-party tools, and while there were learning curves, it was satisfying to see the functionality succeed in the end.

## What we learned
We were all new to React Native and app development
